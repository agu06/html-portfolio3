<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Passionate about the opportunities that today present, optimistic about the future, and learning from the successes
   and failures of yesterday. Trained Economist whose passionate transformation into Product Management was driven by 
   people and innovation. </p>

<p>As part of the product team that helped build a few solutions, I have found out that the best approach/ my approach towards inventiveness is; 
<p> - A practical implementation of a well-defined vision through strategic planning that traverses a detailed 
      understanding of the problem space and its underlying assumptions. At the core of this should be an 
      understanding that only real users can validate any stated expectations.</p>
    - A comprehensive iterative discovery process saddled with user engagement, even at a very early stage. 
      This undoubtedly helps boost the team's confidence and lays a foundation for successful product implementation and lunch. 
      The key to the success of this stage, which is a lesson learned every time, is to ensure that the tactics applied are analytically driven, 
      and the data is tracked efficiently. 
    - Once launched, the job now is to get the product through its life-cycle effectively. Starting with 
      the introductory phase, which is usually defined by challenges such as generating demand and heavy expenditure. 
      That is why I must be a part of a team that develops a product that solves someoneâ€™s problem out there.</p>
